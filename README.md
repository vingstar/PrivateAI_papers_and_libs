Currently, this is just a self-maintained repository for keeping up with the lateset advancement in Privacy-Preserving AI field. It consists of two main parts, the first being the academic papers, the other being the concrete engineering libraries.


## Academic Papers

### CryptFlow [link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/09/CrypTFlow.pdf)
> Kumar, Nishant, et al. "Cryptflow: Secure tensorflow inference." 2020 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP). IEEE, 2020

This is an end-to-end system for tranforming native TensorFlow program to MPC-backed program, done by Microsoft teams. The aim is the same as [LatticeX/Rosetta](https://github.com/LatticeX-Foundation/Rosetta).
